# XarigamiND Images Module

Images is a Xarigami Utility Module. It is currently responsible for basic image manipulation, including the following:

* Resize Image files
* Crop image files
* Rotate image files
* Add text to an image file (think buttons here...)

Example:

Resize an image's width while keeping the proportions:

<xar:image-resize src="23" width="92px" constrain="1" label="my logo" />
